This is a simple Car Price Prediction APP.It takes in the 'year', the respective Car was purchsed on, the showroom price, the number of Kilometers driven, the number of owners that previously have had this car, the fuel type of the car, whether it is Petrol or Diesel. Transmission type and whether you are a dealer or not a dealer. Based upon this information entered by the user, it can predict the car price. The model has been trained on Random Forest Regression from scikit-learn library.

## Motivation
Welcome reader, so from past one year i have been actively planning and working upon my transition into data science. I started learning Python from youtube in the beginning of january this year and i am so very comfortable at using it now, that i have deployed this basic app on Heroku platform. So, i wish everybody best in their life and personal goals.

## Technical Aspect
1. Training a RandomForestRegression model from scikit-learn API.
2. Creating a Web App using Flask and deploying the app on Heroku.
  ..*The Web App asks for basic details such as Fuel-type, the date of purchase.
  ..*Based upon the traing predicts the price of the car.
